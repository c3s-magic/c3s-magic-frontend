The goal of this diagnostic is to estimate the relative change in heat/cold wave characteristics in future climates compared to a reference period using daily maximum or minimum temperatures. 

The user also selects whether to compute the frequency of exceedances or non-exceedances, which corresponds to extreme high or extreme low temperature events, respectively. The user can also select the minimum duration for an event to be classified as a heat/cold wave and the season of interest. 

The diagnostic calculates the number of days in which the temperature exceeds or does not exceeds the necessary threshold for a consecutive number of days in future climate projections. The result is an annual time series of the total number of heat/cold wave days for the selected season at each grid point. The final output is the average number of heat/cold wave days for the selected season in the future climate projections.

The Heatwave and coldwave duration metric allows the user to compute the total duration of "extreme spells"; the total number of days in a season where the temperature exceeds a threshold over a minimum number of consecutive days. Other tools for computing such events are also available, but the novelty of this tool is that the users can select their own thresholds (based on quantiles) and minimum duration for an event.
