The [Climate Variability Diagnostics Package (CVDP)](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/CVC/cvdp/) developed by NCAR's Climate Analysis Section is an analysis tool that documents the major modes of climate variability in models and observations, including ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation, Northern and Southern Annular Modes, North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific North and South American teleconnection patterns.

The package is also distributed with the ESMValTool.
