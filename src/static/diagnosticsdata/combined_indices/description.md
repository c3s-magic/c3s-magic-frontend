This diagnostic combines indices for gridded data from a single or multiple models. 

The user has the option to include weights, e.g. when combining the components of the insurance risk indice a user may want to give higher weighting to the flood index for a region where flooding is the highest source of insured losses. The user can also compute the area-weighted averages for the indices, or for any other variable, where gridsare assumed to be regular.
