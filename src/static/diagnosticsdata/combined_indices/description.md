For the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the difference between two area averages is computed. The user can also select the season (indicating the initial and final month), a smoothing running window and wether to standarize or not the data fany other variable where grids are assumed to be regular.
