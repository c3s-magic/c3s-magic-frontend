The goal of this diagnostic is to compute a vulnerability indicator for the diurnal temperature range (DTR); the maximum variation in temperature within a period of 24 hours at a given location. This indicator was first proposed by the energy sector, to identify locations which may experience increased diurnal temperature variation in the future, which would put additional stress on the operational management of district heating systems. This indicator was defined as the DTR exceeding 5 degrees celsius at a given location and day of the year [(Deandreis et al., N.D.)](http://secif.ipsl.fr/images/SECIF/documents/Communication/fiche_invulnerable/RC_indicateur_EN.pdf). Projections of this indicator currently present high uncertainties, uncertainties associated to both Tmax and Tmin in future climate projections.

As well as being of use to the energy sector, the global‚Äêaverage DTR has been evaluated using both observations and climate model simulations [(Braganza et. al., 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2004GL019998) and changes in the mean and variability of the DTR have been shown to have a wide range of impacts on society, such as on the transmission of diseases [(Lambrechts et al., 2011;](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1101377108) [Paaijmans et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1006422107) and energy consumption [(Deandreis et al., N.D.)](http://secif.ipsl.fr/images/SECIF/documents/Communication/fiche_invulnerable/RC_indicateur_EN.pdf).

Thos metric computes first a mean DTR for a reference period using historical simulations and then, the number of days when the DTR from the future climate projections exceeds that of the reference period by 5 degrees or more. The user can define both the reference and projection periods, and the region to be considered. The output produced by this metric consists of a four panel plot showing the maps of the projected mean DTR indicator for each season and a netcdf file containing the corresponding data.

The diurnal temperature variation indicator act as a proxy for energy demand and the wind capacity factor as a proxy for energy supply. The diurnal temperature indicator is the number of days in a season where the daily temperature variation (tasmax - tasmin) exceeds the vulnerability threshold.
Here, the vulnerability threshold is based on the mean daily temperature variation for the  reference period (1960 -1990) + 5 degrees. This definition was proposed in a study conducted for the DALKIA energy company. The capacity factor is computed using the manufacturer provided  power  curves that  relate  power  output  to  steady  winds  blowing  at  hub  height.  The capacity  factor can be derived from power curve values easily, by dividing power output by the nominal capacity of the turbine. Here the 100-m wind heights are extrapolated from the surface wind speeds.
