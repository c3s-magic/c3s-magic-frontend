# Calculate
This is the advanced calculate page, it is adviced to start at the [Tailored Products](#/tailoredproducts) and [Metrics & Diagnostics](#/diagnostics) pages first.

The Magic portal offers pre-calculated datasets for a wide variety of Metrics and Diagnostics. If for some reason a user would like to have the results of a metric with customized settings rather than the defaults normally used, metrics available on the portal can be calculated here. Sign-in is required.

The calculation can be performed on several wps servers. Normally the default suffices. The set of available metrics may vary across wps servers. The documentation for each process contains links to detailed information on the process settings and scientific description.

Once a metric is calculated the results will be available on this page. The [Basket](#/calculate/basket) offers the result files for each metric calculated, and the [Job List](#/calculate/joblist) page lists past calculations performed.
