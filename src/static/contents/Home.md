## Welcome to the C3S-Magic Portal
The Metrics and Access to Global Indices for Climate Projections (MAGIC) portal provides a quick and easy assessment of climate projections using well-established performance metrics. Pre-calculated metric results are available for quick and easy usage of these metrics. The portal also allows the user to configure these criteria, apply them on selected CMIP5 model output and visualize results in the browser or download them onto your local machine.

#### Whom is this portal for?
This portal provides both metrics on model fidelity, targeted to climate scientists and meteorologists, as well as tailored products for different economic sectors, including insurances, agriculture, water management and sustainable energy.
