## Welcome to the C3S-Magic Portal

The Metrics and Access to Global Indices for Climate Projections (MAGIC) portal provides a quick and easy assessment of 
climate projections using well-established metrics. It allows the user to configure these criteria, apply them on CMIP5/6 
model output and visualize the results in the browser or download then onto your local machine.

#### Whom is this portal for?
This portal provides both metrics on model fidelity, targeted to climate scientists and meteorologists, as well as 
tailored products for different economic sectors. The possible users of these products may be relevant to hydrologists, 
insurance advisors, agricultural planners and others.

#### Usage
* To see pre-calculated quality metrics of global circulation models, go to the [Metrics \& Diagnostics](https://portal.c3s-magic.eu/#/diagnostics) section and 
navigate to the selected tool.
* For cross-domain derived diagnostics, go to the [Tailored Products](https://portal.c3s-magic.eu/#/tailoredproducts) page en select your diagnostic of choice.
* To re-evaluate a metric with customized parameters on a selected dataset, sign in with your CEDA account and navigate to the metric of 
choice. Then click **Calculate metric** and enter the metric configuration dialog. Choose the configuration parameters 
and input dataset of the assessment tool, and the resulting job will be scheduled onto the JASMIN cluster and listed in 
your job list. Your job list and basket can be found on the [Calculate](https://portal.c3s-magic.eu/#/calculate/) page.
* For a simple exploration and visualization of CMIP-compliant GCM output, go to [Explore Data](https://portal.c3s-magic.eu/#/esgfsearch) and start browsing.


#### About
The MAGIC portal provides the functions as requested in the C3S tender “Global Climate Projections: Data Access, product 
generation and impact of front-line developments” (GCP).
